        A non-playable character that accompanies Peter in battle, Drax wields nameless Katathian knives and is a durable brawler able to take on many enemies at once. Via his Abilities, he specializes in staggering enemies impervious to regular attacks, and leaving them vulnerable to follow-up attacks. He can also make use of certain liftable objects per the player's commands, which he can throw at opponents. During explorations, Drax can help to move heavy objects around, shove pillars, and destroy walls with a structural weakness so the Guardians can proceed to the next area.
