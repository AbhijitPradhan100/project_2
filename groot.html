    <p style="color:white">Groot, a beloved character from <i>Marvel Comics</i> and the Guardians of the Galaxy series, is a sentient tree-like creature with a unique personality. Created by writer <b>Stan Lee</b>, <b>Larry Lieber</b>, and artist <b>Jack Kirby</b>, Groot first appeared in "Tales to Astonish" #13 in <b>1960</b>. Despite his limited vocabulary, consisting solely of the phrase "I am Groot," Groot's actions speak volumes. With his ability to regenerate and manipulate his body, Groot serves as a powerful ally to the Guardians. Beneath his stoic exterior lies a gentle giant with a heart of gold, forming deep bonds of friendship with his fellow Guardians as they embark on epic adventures.

        Groot is a non-playable ally who assists Peter in and out of battle. During level explorations, Groot can attach roots to moorings and create a bridge for the Guardians or he can lift platforms to higher ground. In battle, he is a vigorous defender, able to withstand large high amounts of damage. He focuses on crowd control; thanks to his Abilities, in early combat, he can entangle enemies and hold them in place for a while, while his Mega Ability Gift of the Florae will heal the party. Unlike the other Guardians, Groot has no weapons himself—he generates branches to attack—nor clothes, but has a Harness that Rocket uses to climbs on top of to shoot his Bye-Bye Engine.
