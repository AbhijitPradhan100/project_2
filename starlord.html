        Peter is the only character directly controlled by the player during level exploration and combat, but as the Guardians' leader, he is able to issue commands to the others. While using his personal cassette player, he is also able to motivate, or revive, the team via the Huddle mechanic, and boost their damage by choosing the correct words. His Abilities are varied, with two being damaging attacks, and the other two meant for tactical management.
