        Gamora is a non-playable character who assists Peter in and out of battle. In battle, true to her moniker, she is a skilled assassin who swiftly eliminates targets by delivering quick, high damage attacks. Using her blade Godslayer, she will deal the most combat damage to single enemies but can still attack multiple enemies at once with her Abilities. In explorations, Gamora can help Peter by remove obstacles to make way for the crew, can climb walls and pull Peter to higher ground, and cut certain out-of-reach objects. This generally can be used during battle, where Gamora can cut down hanging objects to drop on opponents.
