        Rocket is a non-playable character who assists Peter in battle and explorations. He is the team's technical expert: he can hack into multiple devices, and can help Peter improve his equipment with collected Components on Workbenchs. Due to his size, he is able to squeeze into spaces too small for the others in order to open paths. In action, Rocket (called "The Loose Cannon") is a weapons expert who attacks from a distance, and focuses on damaging multiple targets at a time with his Abilities. He sometimes climbs on top of Groot, thanks to a harness, to shoot his Bye-Bye Engine.
